- **Colors**:
  - **Background Color**: The app uses a black (`#000000`) background for a sleek dark theme.
  - **Primary Color (Highlights)**: Golden yellow (`#ffdf00`) is used for borders, buttons, and task checkboxes, providing a neon-like contrast.
  - **Task Text Color**: Aqua (`#00ffff`) is used for the task input and list items, offering a sharp, tech-inspired look against the dark background.
  - **Modal Background**: A translucent white background (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.13)`) is applied to modals for a soft glow effect.

  
## CSS Reset

A **CSS reset** is used in this project to remove the default styling applied by different browsers. This helps in achieving consistency in appearance across all browsers. The reset CSS sets the margin, padding, and borders to zero for all HTML elements, and ensures block elements are displayed correctly.

### Reset CSS Example:

* html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
article, aside, canvas, details, embed,
figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup,
menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
time, mark, audio, video {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
